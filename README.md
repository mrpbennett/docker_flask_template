# Flask, Docker Template üê≥

A GitHub template for Flask running docker, also using TailwindCSS via CDN within `index.html`

The template is also set up to use `.env` files via `python-dotenv`.

You will need to create a `.env` of your own, incase the `.gitignore` file didnt catch it during copying of this template.


### Packages included in template

- [`flask`](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/)
- [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)
- [TailWindCSS via their CDN](https://tailwindcss.com)
